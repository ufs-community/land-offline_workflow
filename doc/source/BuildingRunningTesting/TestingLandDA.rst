************************************
Testing the Land DA Workflow
************************************

This chapter provides instructions for using the Land DA CTest suite. These steps are designed for use on :ref:`Level 1 <LevelsOfSupport>` systems (e.g., Hera and Orion) and may require significant changes on other systems. 

.. attention:: 

   This chapter assumes that the user has already built the Land DA System according to the instructions in :numref:`Section %s <BuildRunLandDA>` and has access to the data provided in the most recent release. (See :numref:`Table %s <Level1Data>` for the locations of pre-staged data on NOAA :term:`RDHPCS`.)

Process
*********

Method #1: Run from the ``build`` Directory
============================================

From the working directory (``$LANDDAROOT``), navigate to ``build`` and run: 

.. code-block:: console
   
   cd land-DA_workflow/sorc/build
   salloc --ntasks 8 --exclusive --qos=debug --partition=<partition> --time=00:30:00 --account=<account_name>
   source ../../versions/build.ver_<platform>
   module use ../../modulefiles
   module load build_<platform>_intel 
   ctest

where ``<account_name>`` corresponds to the user's actual account name, ``<partition>`` is a valid partition on the platform of choice (e.g., ``debug`` or ``orion``), and ``<platform>`` is ``hera``, ``orion``, or ``hercules``.

This will submit an interactive job, load the appropriate modulefiles, and run the CTests. 

If the tests are successful, a message will be printed to the console. For example:

.. code-block:: console

   Test project /work/noaa/epic/${USER}/landda/land-DA_workflow/sorc/build
       Start 1: test_create_ens
   1/4 Test #1: test_create_ens ..................   Passed   13.91 sec
       Start 2: test_letkfoi_snowda
   2/4 Test #2: test_letkfoi_snowda ..............   Passed   67.94 sec
       Start 3: test_apply_jediincr
   3/4 Test #3: test_apply_jediincr ..............   Passed    6.88 sec
       Start 4: test_ufs_datm_land
   4/4 Test #4: test_ufs_datm_land ...............   Passed   98.56 sec

   100% tests passed, 0 tests failed out of 4

   Total Test time (real) = 187.29 sec

Method #2: Run from the ``test`` Directory
============================================

.. note:: 

   This method works only on Hera, Orion, and Hercules and will run even if the Land DA System has not been built yet. 

From the working directory (``$LANDDAROOT``), navigate to ``test`` and run: 

.. code-block:: console
   
   cd land-DA_workflow/sorc/test
   ./run_ctest_platform.sh

The CTest working directory will appear in ``build/test``, and the log file can be found in ``build/Testing/Temporary``.

Method #3: Run Tests Using a Container
============================================

.. attention::

   The container CTest functionality has been tested in Jenkins. It should be able to run on a sufficiently large cloud instance. However, it is considered unsupported functionality because it has not been thoroughly tested on the cloud for use by the public. 

For containers, the CTest functionality is wrapped in a Dockerfile. Therefore, users will need to build the Dockerfile to run the CTests. Since the Land DA container is quite large, this process can take a long time --- potentially hours. In the future, the development team hopes to simplify and shorten this process. 

.. code-block:: console

   git clone -b release/public-v2.0.0 --recursive https://github.com/ufs-community/land-DA_workflow.git
   cd land-DA_workflow/sorc/test/ci
   sudo systemctl start docker
   sudo docker build -f Dockerfile -t dockerfile-ci-ctest:release .

.. note::
   
   ``sudo`` may not be required in front of the last two commands on all systems. 

Tests
*******

The CTests test the operability of four major elements of the Land DA System: ``create_ens``, ``letkfoi_snowda``, ``apply_jediincr``, and ``ufs_datm_land``. The tests and their dependencies are listed in the ``land-DA_workflow/test/CMakeLists.txt`` file. 

.. list-table:: *Land DA CTests*
   :widths: 20 50
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Test
     - Description
   * - ``test_create_ens``
     - Tests creation of a pseudo-ensemble for use in :term:`LETKF-OI`.
   * - ``test_letkfoi_snowda``
     - Tests the use of LETKF-OI to assimilate snow data. 
   * - ``test_apply_jediincr``
     - Tests the ability to add a JEDI increment.
   * - ``test_ufs_datm_land``
     - Tests proper functioning of the UFS land model (``ufs-datm-lnd``)

.. note::

   There are plans to add workflow end-to-end (WE2E) tests to the Land DA System. Currently, when ``WE2E_TEST: "YES"``, this functionality checks that the output from the Jan. 3-4, 2000 sample case is within the tolerance set (via the ``WE2E_ATOL`` variable) at the end of the three main tasks --- *analysis*, *forecast*, and *post_anal*. The results are logged by default in ``we2e.log``. In the future, this functionality will be expanded to encompass a full range of WE2E tests.
